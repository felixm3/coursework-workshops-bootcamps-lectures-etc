## Lecture 01: DNA Polymerase

### Notes

1. DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid.
2. DNA polymerase catalyzes the addition of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) to a growing DNA strand.
3. The most common form of the DNA double helix is B-form DNA.
4. Each strand of DNA is a polynucleotide (polymer of nucleotides).
5. A nucleotide has 3 components: 5-carbon sugar, phosphate group, and one of 4 nitrogenous bases.
6. The 4 nitrogenous bases of DNA are: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).
7. The nitrogenous base is always attached at the 1' (1-prime) carbon of the 5-carbon sugar.
8. The phosphate group is at the 5' carbon of the 5-carbon sugar, and connects to the 3' carbon of the 5-carbon sugar in the neighboring nucleotide.
9. The 5-carbon sugar is called deoxyribose because it's [missing a hydroxyl group at the 2' carbon] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/The_difference_between_ribose_and_deoxyribose.png), which is present in ribose.
10. Nucleotides in DNA are called deoxyribonucleotides because they contain deoxyribose.
11. Nucleotides are linked in the DNA strand by phosphodiester bonds, where the phosphate group of one nucleotide binds to the 3' carbon of the neighboring nucleotide.
12. The sugars and the phosphate group make up the DNA backbone.
13. The carbon numbering is used to describe the directionality of the two DNA strands: 5' to 3'
14. In drawings where the 2 DNA strands are shown one above the other, the top strand is usually drawn in the 5' to 3' orientation, where the 5' carbon of each sugar is on the left. The bottom strand is drawn in the 3' to 5' orientation, where the 3' carbon of each sugar is on the left.
