## Lecture 01: DNA Polymerase

### Notes

1. DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid.
2. DNA polymerase catalyzes the addition of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) to a growing DNA strand.
3. The most common form of the DNA double helix is B-form DNA.
4. Each strand of DNA is a polynucleotide (polymer of nucleotides).
5. A nucleotide has 3 components: 5-carbon sugar, phosphate group, and one of 4 nitrogenous bases.
6. The 4 nitrogenous bases of DNA are: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).
7. The nitrogenous base is always attached at the 1' (1-prime) carbon of the 5-carbon sugar.
8. The phosphate group is at the 5' carbon of the 5-carbon sugar, and connects to the 3' carbon of the 5-carbon sugar in the neighboring nucleotide.
9. The 5-carbon sugar is called deoxyribose because it's [missing a hydroxyl group at the 2' carbon] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/The_difference_between_ribose_and_deoxyribose.png), which is present in ribose.
10. Nucleotides in DNA are called deoxyribonucleotides because they contain deoxyribose.
11. Nucleotides are linked in the DNA strand by phosphodiester bonds, where the phosphate group of one nucleotide binds to the 3' carbon of the neighboring nucleotide.
12. The sugars and the phosphate group make up the DNA backbone.
13. The carbon numbering is used to describe the directionality of the two DNA strands: 5' to 3'
14. In drawings where the 2 DNA strands are shown one above the other, the top (Watson) strand is usually drawn in the 5' to 3' orientation, where the 5' carbon of each sugar is on the left. The bottom (Crick) strand is drawn in the 3' to 5' orientation, where the 3' carbon of each sugar is on the left.
15. The nucleotides are connected through covalent phosphodiester bonds in the backbone.
16. The two DNA strands in the helix interact through multiple hydrogen bonds between complementary bases on opposite strands.
17. Two complementary bases interact through multiple hydrogen bonds to form a unit called a base pair.
18. Hydrogen bonding contributes to the specificity of base pairing with adenine (A) preferentially pairing with thymine (T) through 2 hydrogen bonds and cytosine (C) preferentially pairing with guanine (G) through 3 hydrogen bonds.
19. An A/T base pair (2 H-bonds) has an energy of ~10 kJ/mol while a G/C base pair (3 H-bonds)has an energy of ~15 kJ/mol.
20. ThYmine and cYtosine are pYrimidines characterized by their single-ring structure.
21. Adenine and guanine are purines characterized by their double-ring structure.
22. Non-complementary base pairs e.g. GT do not form strong hydrogen bonds and disturb the helix structure.
23. Each turn of the double helix measures approximately 10 base pairs.
24. Pi-pi interactions between bases in the helical stack (base stacking interactions) contribute to the stability of the double helix.
25. Consecutive G/C basepairs have a stacking energy of ~45 kJ/mole. Consecutive A/T basepairs have a stacking energy of ~20 kJ/mole.
26. A/T rich regions of DNA melt more readily than G/C rich regions because of the differences in hydrogen bonding and base stacking energies.
27. The regularity of the helical structure forms two repeating and alternating spaces, called the major and minor grooves. These grooves act as base pair recognition and binding sites for proteins.
28. The major groove contains base pair specific information while the minor groove is largely base pair nonspecific. This is due to the pattern of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors that proteins can interact with in the grooves.
29. The fundamental reason to have DNA replication is to duplicate the genome.
30. The genome contains the blueprint for every cellular function. All fundamental events of a cell are controlled by the genome.
31. Mistakes in genome duplication on some occasions have positive effects (new functions) but generally have negative effects (cancer, cell death, reduced ability to grow). 
32. DNA replication is rapid: ~100-1000 base pairs per second.
33. DNA replication is complete: every base pair is replicated (a few exceptions e.g. telomeres)
34. Genome replication (DNA replication + proofreading + repair) is accurate: 1 mistake every $10^10$ base pairs. For E. coli with genome ~ 5 x $10^6$, this means ~ 1 in 1000 organisms have mistake. 
35. For H. sapiens with genome ~ 3 x $10^9$, this means a mistake every ~ 3 cell divisions. Fortunately, most mistakes are not in critical coding regions of the genome.
36. Each human cell has ~ 2 meters of DNA. The human body has enough DNA to get to the sun.
37. Molecular cloning, PCR, and genome sequencing are a result of studies of DNA replication.
38. DNA replication is frequently a target of drugs (chemotherapy, anti-virals) so important to understand to develop better drugs.
39. E. coli cells replicate the genome in ~ 40 minutes.
40. The substrate for DNA replication is the primer-template junction, which consists of a single-stranded DNA template with an annealed primer that has a free 3' OH (hydroxyl)

42. xx
43. Mutations can cause diseases like cancer. Mutations can also cause bacteria and viruses to become resistant to drugs.
