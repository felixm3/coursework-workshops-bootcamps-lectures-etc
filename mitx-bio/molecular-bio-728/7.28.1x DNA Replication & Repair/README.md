Topics discussed cover the events that control genome maintenance: chromosome duplication, repair, and recombination.

- how do cells replicate their genomes?
- how do cells repair the DNA when there's a mistake or DNA damage?
- how do cells recombine the DNA in response to breaks, or during meiosis?
- how does the cell accomplish the various processes (DNA duplication/repair/recombination)? What are the detailed molecular mechanisms?
- what are the proteins/RNAs/DNAs required for these processes? How are these coordinated and regulated?
- what are the similarities and differences in these processes between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?
- what do we know, and what do we NOT know, about these cellular processes?
- how did scientists discover these mechanisms?
- what tools/assays/techniques are used to study these processes?
- what are the failsafes in place to keep these processes from going wrong?
